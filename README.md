# Project Name
Tristin's Gmae
Context and date
Platform style game  3/6/2024

Description
The game starts where a traditional platformer would end. The game will have coins that reduce score and bosses right at the beginning rather than end. It gets easier in terms of level design (obstacles and hazards), but harder with the player getting weaker (slower, smaller jump, weaker attacks, etc. 
Theme: Reverse

## Implementation
Which features you included
I included New enemies, Reverse levels, negative coins, and a boss
